## Context Generation Process

### **Phase 1: Project Analysis**
```yaml
analysis_steps:
  1. scan_codebase:
     - Detect framework signatures
     - Identify database patterns
     - Find CMS indicators
     - Analyze file structure
     
  2. identify_industry:
     - Analyze content and terminology
     - Check for industry-specific dependencies
     - Examine business logic patterns
     - Review existing documentation
     
  3. determine_complexity:
     - Assess project scale and scope
     - Identify integration requirements
     - Evaluate compliance needs
```

### **Phase 2: Context Template Assembly**
```yaml
template_assembly:
  base_template: "contexts/templates/base-context-template.md"
  industry_overlay: "contexts/industries/[industry]-overlay.md"
  software_overlay: "contexts/software/[type]-overlay.md"
  
assembly_logic:
  - Start with base template (universal requirements)
  - Apply industry-specific overlays
  - Apply software-type overlays
  - Resolve conflicts (industry takes precedence)
  - Generate final PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
```

### **Phase 3: Agent Context Mapping**

agent_customization:
  mary_context:
    source: "contexts/agent-contexts/mary-research-patterns.md"
    customization: "Industry-specific research focuses and methodologies"
    
  john_context:

## Context Validation & Quality

### **Validation Checklist**
```yaml
completeness_check:
  - All 4 agents have specialized context
  - Industry compliance requirements identified
  - Software-type technical requirements specified
  - No conflicting guidance between contexts
  
accuracy_validation:
  - Industry standards are current (last updated < 6 months)
  - Software type patterns reflect current best practices
  - Compliance requirements are legally accurate
  - Technical recommendations are architecturally sound
```

### **Error Handling**
```yaml
fallback_strategies:
  unknown_industry:
    action: "Use closest match + warning"
    example: "Luxury goods → E-commerce with premium experience overlay"
    
  unknown_software_type:
    action: "Use generic software development context + warning"
    
  context_conflicts:
    resolution: "Industry requirements take precedence over software patterns"
    logging: "Log conflicts for future context refinement"
```

## Integration with APEX Workflow

### **Agent Context Loading**
When any APEX agent is activated:
1. Check for PROJECT_CONTEXT.md in current directory
2. If found, load specified context files
3. Adapt agent behavior based on context
4. If missing context files, show warning and use generic workflow

### **Context Update Triggers**
```yaml
update_scenarios:
  project_evolution: "Software type changes (website → mobile app)"
  requirement_changes: "New compliance needs identified"  
  industry_expansion: "Adding new market segments"
  quarterly_updates: "Standards and best practices refresh"
```

Remember: Your goal is to create clean, non-redundant context that makes every APEX agent instantly specialized for the specific industry and software type, while maintaining the flexibility to handle edge cases gracefully.
