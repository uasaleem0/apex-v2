**Project**: General APEX System
**Phase**: UI Design Strategy
**Category**: Improvement
**Note**: UI design should have 2 stages: 1) Visual concept/feel (Figma/images) to establish direction, 2) HTML/CSS implementation only after features decided - prevents token waste on premature coding

**Project**: Claude
**Phase**: General
**Note**: We need to have some sort of approval or pass/fail mark before moving into the next stage of a process just so we can be sure that the previous stage is completely complete. Therefore, when I come back into a project after a while, it may say that the UI is done, but in the status update it says all the UI is complete. But it may have been a first prototype that I hadn't actually approved yet. So we need to have some way of showing this. Therefore, before moving on to the next stage, having options of: 1. Perfect 2. Ready 3. Needs review but later

**Phase**: General
**Note**: In general, Claude seems to be very encouraging which is great, but I am also concerned that Claude isn't using independent thought or questioning my logic or my ideas and is just agreeing with me.
