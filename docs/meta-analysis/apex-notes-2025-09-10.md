**Phase**: General
**Note**: PM Phase Issue Logged: User feedback that PM jumped into creating comprehensive deliverables without proper consultation. PM should have asked detailed questions about specific features, priorities, and requirements before creating PRD/user stories. Approach was too presumptive and potentially not industry-specific enough. User hasn't provided specifics yet about actual website requirements. Need more consultative approach in future PM phases.

**Phase**: General
**Note**: SYSTEM ISSUE: Assistant not recognizing ./apex-note command properly - treating it as conversation instead of just logging to meta-analyst notes and continuing. Should log silently and continue conversation without acknowledgment.

**Phase**: General
**Note**: USER VERIFICATION REQUEST: User asking to confirm meta-analyst is active and supervising conversation, picking up on process issues and errors. Need confirmation of meta-analyst oversight status.

**Note**: PM is pushing to create a PRD without systematic understanding of what we have covered and what is missing, I dont think its following protocol

**Project**: Claude
**Phase**: General
**Note**: PM PROCESS IMPROVEMENT: User noted that for website projects, after establishing sitemap and page flows, we should compare to competitors from previous analyst work. Every design decision should be consciously compared to competitors with explicit decisions to differentiate or follow category conventions. This should be a constant iteration throughout website design process.

**Project**: Claude
**Phase**: General
**Note**: PM PROCESS IMPROVEMENT: User requested that PM section for website/app projects (industry agnostic) should display a process flow/roadmap for the user showing: 1) What is the process of creating the PRD, 2) What needs to be covered, 3) The different steps from bird's eye view, 4) Clear indication of current section/phase, 5) What user needs to include in responses for each section. This helps user understand their role and required input at each stage of systematic PRD development.

**Phase**: General
**Note**: UX PHASE PROCESS ERROR: UX Expert incorrectly attempted to use Task tool for technical command execution instead of starting with visual design creation (images/wireframes). User corrected that UX should start with 3-stage visual process: 1) Create visual wireframes/mockups (images), 2) Get user approval, 3) Convert to technical specs. UX jumped to technical implementation instead of visual design review process.
