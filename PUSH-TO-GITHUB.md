# ðŸš€ Push BMAD Foundation v2.0 to GitHub

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repositories

### Create Foundation Repository (Public Template)
1. Go to https://github.com/your-username (or your organization)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `claude-foundation`
4. Description: `BMAD Foundation v2.0 - Enhanced development methodology with specialized agents`
5. **Make it PUBLIC** (so others can use as template)
6. **Do NOT initialize** with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Create Company Repository (Private)
1. Click "New repository" again
2. Name: `wisdom-practice-claude` (or your company name)
3. Description: `Private company data for BMAD Foundation - brand context and projects`
4. **Make it PRIVATE** (contains business-sensitive information)
5. **Do NOT initialize** with README
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Foundation Repository

```bash
cd ~/Claude/claude-foundation-v2

# Add your GitHub remote (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/claude-foundation.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Push Company Repository

```bash
cd ~/Claude/wisdom-practice-claude

# Add your GitHub remote (replace with your actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wisdom-practice-claude.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Test the Installation

### On a New Machine (or Clean Directory):

```bash
# Install foundation
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/claude-foundation.git ~/Claude-Test
cd ~/Claude-Test
./setup.sh

# Link your company data
./bin/claude link-company-repo https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wisdom-practice-claude.git

# Create your first enhanced project
./bin/claude new-project coaching-website website --company=wisdom-practice
```

## Step 5: Share with Team Members

Send team members these commands:
```bash
# Everyone runs the same setup
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/claude-foundation.git ~/Claude
cd ~/Claude && ./setup.sh
./bin/claude link-company-repo https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wisdom-practice-claude.git

# Now everyone has access to the same company context and can create projects
```
