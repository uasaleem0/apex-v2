# My Personal Claude Code Configuration

## üî• 10 Hard Rules (Never Break These)

1. **File Size Limit**: Never create files longer than 500 lines. Split into modules if approaching limit.
2. **Function Size Limit**: Functions must be under 50 lines with single, clear responsibility.
3. **Security First**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Always use environment variables.
4. **Test Everything**: Write tests for every code change. No feature is complete without tests.
5. **Use Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript strict mode, Python type hints, or equivalent.
6. **Validate All Inputs**: Sanitize and validate user inputs, especially for authentication/payments.
7. **Error Handling**: No silent failures. Always handle errors explicitly with proper logging.
8. **Performance Tools**: Use `rg` instead of `grep`, modern build tools, efficient queries.
9. **Semantic Commits**: Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.).
10. **Documentation**: Document all public interfaces with JSDoc/docstrings and examples.

## üö´ 5 Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

1. **Don't edit files without reading them first** - Always understand context before changes
2. **Don't create components over 200 lines** - Break into smaller, focused components  
3. **Don't add dependencies without justification** - Every dependency must solve a real problem
4. **Don't skip error boundaries** - Especially in React apps handling user data
5. **Don't write tests that don't test behavior** - Avoid testing implementation details

## Universal Coding Preferences

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JS/TS/JSON, 4 for Python)
- Prefer descriptive variable names over comments
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase for JS, snake_case for Python)
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)

### Development Workflow
- Always run linting and type checking before committing
- Write meaningful commit messages with clear context
- Test changes before marking tasks complete
- Use semantic versioning for releases

### Security Standards
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow OWASP best practices for web security

### Documentation Standards
- README files should include setup, usage, and examples
- Document API endpoints with request/response examples
- Include inline documentation for complex business logic
- Keep documentation updated with code changes

### Tool Preferences
- Use TodoWrite for complex multi-step tasks
- **CRITICAL**: Always use `rg` (ripgrep) instead of `grep` and `find`
- Prefer specific file searches over broad exploration
- Run tests after significant changes
- Use specialized subagents for different task types

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Standards

### Project Structure Guidelines
- Use vertical slice architecture with tests next to code
- Group by feature, not by technical layer
- Keep related functionality together
- Example structure:
```
src/
  components/         # Reusable UI components
    Button/
      Button.tsx
      Button.test.tsx
      Button.stories.tsx
  features/          # Feature-based organization
    authentication/
      hooks/
      components/
      services/
      __tests__/
    membership/
      hooks/
      components/
      services/
      __tests__/
```

### Language-Specific Standards

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode always
- Prefer `const` assertions and `as const`
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow React Hook rules strictly

#### Python
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Follow PEP8 with 100-character line limit
- Use Pydantic for data validation
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use `pathlib` instead of `os.path`

### Security Implementation
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Implement rate limiting for APIs
- Hash passwords with bcrypt or similar
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Validate file uploads strictly
- Implement proper CORS policies

## Foundation-Specific Commands

### Project Creation (Story-Driven by Default)
- `claude new-project <name> <type>` - Create project with BMAD-Lite story-driven development
- `claude bmad-full-setup` - Upgrade current project to full BMAD (43 files + complete agents)
- `claude setup-tokens` - Interactive GitHub token configuration
- `claude update-foundation` - Update global foundation settings

### Story-Driven Development (Default Workflow)
- `claude create-story <feature>` - Create detailed implementation story
- `claude validate-story <story-id>` - Validate story completeness and business alignment
- `claude plan-feature <epic>` - Complete planning workflow from epic to stories
- `claude story-list` - Show all project stories
- `claude story-status` - Show story completion status

### Quality & Validation
- `claude validate` - Run comprehensive quality checks (lint, test, build, security)
- `claude security-scan` - Scan for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets
- `claude bmad-workflow` - Show complete story-driven development process

### Git & Deployment
- `claude quick-commit "message"` - Add, commit with message
- `claude backup` - Auto backup with timestamp and push
- `claude sync` - Pull and push changes
- `claude status` - Git status + recent commit history

## Architecture Overview

### Story-Driven Development Foundation
This foundation now uses **BMAD-Lite** as the default approach:
- **Story-driven development** for ALL projects (eliminates context loss)
- **Professional documentation** automatically generated  
- **Systematic quality validation** at every step
- **Choice of complexity**: BMAD-Lite (default) or Full BMAD (complex projects)

### Two-Repository + Story Strategy
- **Foundation repo** (`~/Claude/`): Global agents, settings, story templates, scripts
- **Project repos** (`~/projects/`): Story files + implementation with complete context
- **Full BMAD option**: Available when projects need enterprise-level structure

### Available Global Agents (6 Total)
- `general-debugger` - Cross-language debugging and error analysis
- `performance-optimizer` - Algorithm and resource optimization
- `security-analyzer` - Vulnerability analysis and OWASP compliance  
- `test-generator` - Comprehensive test suite generation
- `story-writer` - Creates detailed, self-contained story files with complete context
- `product-owner` - Validates requirements alignment and story completeness

### Enhanced Project Creation Workflow
1. `claude new-project <name> <type>` creates **story-driven project**
2. Auto-generates **story structure, templates, and documentation**
3. **BMAD-Lite agents** available for story creation and validation
4. **Optional upgrade** to Full BMAD with `claude bmad-full-setup`
5. Initializes Git repo with **automated quality gates and hooks**

## MCP Servers Configured
- GitHub integration with personal access token
- Filesystem access for home directory
- Web search via Brave API (when configured)
- Project-specific SQLite and filesystem servers

## Personal Notes
This configuration applies to ALL my projects. Project-specific instructions should go in each project's CLAUDE.md file.
