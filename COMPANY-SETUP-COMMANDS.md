## üìã Validation Prompts Library

### **Recognition Validation Prompts**

#### **Target Audience Recognition Test**
```
I'm going to read you a target audience description. After hearing it, tell me:
1. Do you immediately think "that's exactly me" or "that's definitely not me"?
2. What specific phrases made you feel recognized (or not)?
3. What's missing that would make you feel more seen?

[Read target audience description]

Scoring:
- High Recognition (90-100%): Immediate strong identification
- Medium Recognition (70-89%): Some identification with reservations  
- Low Recognition (0-69%): Little to no identification
```

#### **Pain Point Resonance Test**
```
I'll describe some pain points. For each one, rate how much it resonates:
1. "I've never felt this way" (0 points)
2. "This sometimes applies to me" (1 point) 
3. "This definitely describes my experience" (2 points)
4. "This is exactly my biggest frustration" (3 points)

[Read each pain point]

Scoring:
- Total 12-15 points: High resonance (ready to use)
- Total 8-11 points: Medium resonance (needs refinement)
- Total 0-7 points: Low resonance (needs complete rework)
```

### **Differentiation Validation Prompts**

#### **Competitive Differentiation Test**
```
I'll describe a business solution. After hearing it, tell me:
1. What company/solution does this sound most like?
2. What makes this different from [top 3 competitors]?
3. Why would someone choose this over the obvious alternative?
4. What's unique about the approach/method?

[Read value proposition and approach]

Pass Criteria:
‚úÖ Can't easily name a direct competitor match
‚úÖ Clear differentiation from top alternatives  
‚úÖ Unique approach/method identified
‚úÖ Compelling reason to choose this option
```

#### **Category Creation Test**  
```
Complete this sentence: "We're not just another _______, we're _______."

Quality Assessment:
- **Category of One**: Creates entirely new category
- **Subcategory Leader**: Owns a specific niche within existing category
- **Better Alternative**: Improved version of existing solution
- **Me Too**: No clear differentiation (requires rework)
```

### **Clarity Validation Prompts**

#### **Stranger Test**
```
I'm going to pretend I've never heard of your company. Read me your:
1. Brand essence statement
2. Target audience description  
3. Value proposition

Then I'll tell you:
- What I think your company does
- Who I think it's for
- Why someone would choose you

Accuracy scoring:
- 90-100%: Crystal clear positioning
- 70-89%: Mostly clear with minor confusion
- 50-69%: Somewhat confusing, needs clarification
- 0-49%: Very confusing, major rework needed
```

#### **Elevator Pitch Test**
```
You have 30 seconds to explain your company to someone at a networking event.
After your explanation, they should be able to:
1. Understand what problem you solve
2. Know if they're your target customer  
3. Identify what makes you different
4. Decide if they want to learn more

Test with 5 different people outside your industry.
