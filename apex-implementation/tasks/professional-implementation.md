# Professional Implementation Task
**Agent**: Sally (@ux-expert)  
**Phase**: 6 of 6 - Systematic Implementation with Iterative Refinement  
**Trigger**: Phase 5 completed with approved SuperDesign preview

## Task Overview
Convert approved SuperDesign preview to production-ready code using systematic implementation approach based on project size.

## Prerequisites
- superdesign_preview.html and component_library.json exist
- Complete interactive preview approved by user
- All components, animations, and responsive behavior defined

## Execution Steps

### 1. Project Size Assessment & Strategy
Determine implementation approach:
- **Small (1-5 pages)**: Implement complete website at once
- **Medium (6-15 pages)**: Page-by-page with user approval per page  
- **Large (15+ pages)**: Section-by-section with frequent checkpoints

**User Approval Required**: Confirm implementation strategy and timeline expectations.

### 2. Technology Stack Setup
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript (type safety)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (consistent with design system)
- **Components**: ShadCN UI components (from approved selections)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (from mood board specifications)
- **Performance**: Next.js Image optimization, font optimization, bundle optimization

### 3. Systematic Implementation
**Execute based on approved strategy:**

**Small Projects**: 
- Implement all pages simultaneously
- Single comprehensive testing cycle
- Single final approval

**Medium Projects**:
- Implement page-by-page
- Progress tracking: "Page X of Y completed, Next: [page], Remaining: [list]"
- User approval after each page before proceeding

**Large Projects**:
- Implement by logical sections (header, main content, footer)
- Frequent checkpoints with user approval
- Continuous integration testing

### 4. Professional Quality Standards
**Ensure production-ready quality:**
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance with proper error handling
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals compliance, optimized images and fonts
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first implementation, tested across breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, semantic HTML, ARIA labels
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser testing and consistent rendering

### 5. Animation & Interaction Implementation
- **Framer Motion Integration**: All animations from approved mood board
- **Performance Optimization**: GPU-accelerated properties, reduced-motion preferences
- **Interactive States**: Hover effects, form validation, loading states from component selections

### 6. Testing & Refinement Cycles
**Systematic quality validation:**
- **Functional Testing**: All interactions work as expected
- **Responsive Testing**: Mobile and desktop behavior matches preview
- **Performance Audit**: Core Web Vitals compliance
- **User Testing**: "Does this match the approved SuperDesign preview?"

**Iterative Refinement**: Address feedback until user confirms "This implementation is complete and approved"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Perfect match to approved SuperDesign preview
- [ ] Production-ready code following quality standards
- [ ] Responsive design functional across all devices
- [ ] Performance optimized (Core Web Vitals compliant)
- [ ] Accessibility compliant (WCAG AA minimum)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully

## Error Handling
- **Performance issues**: Optimize before proceeding to next section
- **Responsive behavior breaks**: Fix before moving forward
- **Preview fidelity issues**: Realign with approved SuperDesign immediately
- **User feedback**: Resolve completely before marking tasks complete

## Output Files
- `production_code/` (complete website implementation)
- `implementation_log.md` (detailed implementation record)
- `final_approval.md` (user acceptance and project completion)
