# Professional Implementation Task
**Agent**: Sally (@ux-expert)  
**Phase**: 6 of 6 - Systematic Implementation with Iterative Refinement  
**Trigger**: Phase 5 (Component Integration) completed with approved SuperDesign preview

## Task Overview
Convert approved SuperDesign preview to production-ready code using systematic implementation approach based on project size, with continuous testing and refinement.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 5 completed: superdesign_preview.html and component_library.json exist
- Complete interactive preview approved by user
- All components, animations, and responsive behavior defined
- Implementation specifications documented

## Execution Steps

### 1. Project Size Assessment & Implementation Strategy
Determine optimal implementation approach based on project scope:

```yaml
SIZE_ASSESSMENT:
  project_categorization:
    small_project:
      criteria: "1-5 pages, basic functionality, standard components"
      approach: "Implement complete website at once"
      timeline: "Single implementation cycle"
      
    medium_project:
      criteria: "6-15 pages, moderate complexity, some custom features"
      approach: "Page-by-page implementation with testing"
      timeline: "Multiple cycles, user approval per page"
      
    large_project:
      criteria: "15+ pages, complex functionality, extensive custom features"
      approach: "Section-by-section implementation"
      timeline: "Systematic build with frequent checkpoints"

  implementation_recommendation: |
    "Based on your project scope, I recommend: [SIZE CATEGORY]
    
    Approach: [IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY]
    Process: [DETAILED PROCESS DESCRIPTION]
    Timeline: [EXPECTED PHASES]
    
    Does this approach work for you?"
