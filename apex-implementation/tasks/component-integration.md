# Component Integration Task
**Agent**: Sally (@ux-expert)  
**Phase**: 5 of 6 - Component Library Creation and SuperDesign Preview Integration  
**Trigger**: Phase 4 (Systematic Wireframes) completed with all pages approved

## Task Overview

## Execution Steps

### 1. Component Needs Analysis
Systematically analyze all wireframes to identify required components:

```yaml
COMPONENT_ANALYSIS:
  wireframe_review:
    - Analyze ALL approved wireframes in approved_wireframes/
    - Reference PRD for functional requirements
    - Extract every unique component type needed

  component_identification: |
    Based on wireframes and PRD, identify components needed:
    
    NAVIGATION COMPONENTS:
    - Header/navigation bar
    - Mobile menu/hamburger
    - Breadcrumbs (if applicable)
    - Footer
    
    CONTENT COMPONENTS:
    - Hero sections
    - Feature cards/grids
    - Testimonial sections
    - FAQ sections
    - Content blocks/text areas
    
    INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS:
    - Contact forms
    - Newsletter signup
    - Search functionality
    - Filter/sort controls
    
    UI ELEMENTS:
    - Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary)
    - Input fields and form elements
    - Loading states
    - Alert/notification components
    
    SPECIALIZED COMPONENTS:
    - Pricing tables/cards
    - Team member cards
    - Portfolio/gallery items
    - Blog/news cards
    - [Additional based on specific PRD requirements]

  prioritization:
    - Core components (required for basic functionality)
    - Enhanced components (improve user experience)  
    - Optional components (nice-to-have features)
```

### 2. ShadCN MCP Component Discovery with Professional Prompting
Use ShadCN MCP with specific, reference-driven prompts to find professional components:

```yaml
COMPONENT_DISCOVERY_PROCESS:
  per_component_type:
    process: |
      For each component type identified:
      1. Use ShadCN MCP to search relevant components
      2. Find 3-5 professional options per component type
      3. Present options with visual previews
      4. User selects preferred option
      5. Document selection with reasoning

  professional_prompting_reference:
    template_source: "Reference professional-prompting-templates.md for detailed component prompts"
    
    key_component_templates:
      - component_discovery_prompt: ShadCN MCP search with inspiration matching
      - component_customization_prompt: Brand integration with mood board elements
      - preview_integration_prompt: SuperDesign component integration
      - animation_integration_prompt: Framer Motion animation implementation
      - professional_quality_validation: Component quality checking against standards

  presentation_format: |
    "For [Component Type], here are 5 professional options matching your references:
    
    Option 1: [ShadCN Component] - Like [Reference Site A] navigation
    Style: [Specific description] | Fits Brand: [Reasoning]
    
    Option 2: [ShadCN Component] - Like [Reference Site B] approach
    Style: [Specific description] | Fits Brand: [Reasoning]
    
    ... (continue for all 5 options)
    
    Which option best matches your approved reference style and brand personality?"

  selection_documentation:
    - Component chosen and specific reference it matches
    - Brand customizations required (colors, fonts, animations)
    - How it fits with overall design system from wireframes
    - Integration notes for SuperDesign preview

  fallback_options:
    - If ShadCN options insufficient, check other professional libraries
    - React Bits, Aceternity UI, or similar high-quality sources
    - Always reference specific approved inspiration sites
    - Custom component creation only as absolute last resort
```

### 3. Component Library Creation
Build comprehensive library of approved professional components:

```yaml
COMPONENT_LIBRARY_BUILD:
  organization_structure:
    approved_components/
      - navigation/
        - header.json
        - mobile_menu.json

      - specialized/
        - pricing_tables.json
        - team_cards.json
        - [other specialized components]

  component_documentation:
    per_component: |
      {
        "component_name": "Primary Button",
        "source": "ShadCN UI",
        "user_reasoning": "Clean, professional, matches brand personality",

        "responsive_notes": "Works well on mobile and desktop",
        "implementation_priority": "High"
      }

  design_system_integration:
    - Apply design_system.json styling to all components
    - Ensure consistent brand colors across components
    - Apply approved typography choices
    - Maintain spacing consistency from wireframes
```
