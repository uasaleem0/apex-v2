# Core Professional Prompting Guide
**Agent**: Sally (@ux-expert)  
**Purpose**: Essential prompting patterns for professional website creation
**Principle**: Always use specific reference sites, never generic requests

## Reference-Driven Methodology

### Never Use (Generic):
- "Make it professional"
- "Modern design" 
- "Clean and minimalist"
- "Eye-catching design"

### Always Use (Specific):
- "Layout structure like Linear's homepage with bold typography"
- "Navigation approach like Notion's sidebar pattern"
- "Hero section style like Stripe's centered-background approach"
- "Component styling like [specific approved reference site]"

## Core Prompt Templates

### SuperDesign Setup:
```
Initialize SuperDesign with:
- Design Philosophy: [From approved references - e.g., "Linear's bold typography + Notion's accessibility"]
- Color Palette: [From mood board - specific hex codes]
- Typography: [From approved font choices]
- Brand Personality: [From vision capture]
```

### Wireframe Creation:
```
Create 5 wireframe variations for [page]:
REFERENCE INSPIRATION:
- Layout like [Specific Site A]: [exact description]
- Navigation like [Specific Site B]: [exact pattern]
- Content flow: [Priority from vision]

Generate distinct approaches, each referencing different approved sites.
```

### Component Selection:
```
Find professional components for [Component Type]:
INSPIRATION MATCHING:
- Visual style like: [specific approved site element]
- Interaction pattern like: [specific reference behavior]
BRAND REQUIREMENTS:
- Colors: [specific hex codes from mood board]
- Typography: [specific fonts from design system]
Present 5 options matching these criteria.
```

### Quality Validation:
```
Review against professional standards:
- Does this match [approved reference sites] polish level?
- Would users expect this quality from [industry] companies?
- Does this express [brand personality] effectively?
- Any amateur elements needing refinement?
```
