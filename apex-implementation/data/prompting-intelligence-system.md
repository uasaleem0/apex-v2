# Prompting Intelligence System
**Agent**: Sally (@ux-expert)  
**Purpose**: Intelligent prompt generation with user override capability
**Type**: Formula-based system with full user flexibility

## Prompting Philosophy

### Core Principle
**NEVER use generic prompts. ALWAYS use specific, reference-driven, context-aware prompts.**

### User Override Priority
```yaml
PROMPTING_HIERARCHY:
  1. user_custom_prompt: "User provides specific prompt → Use exactly as provided"
  2. intelligent_generation: "System generates context-aware prompt → Present for approval"
  3. formula_guidance: "Provide prompting formula → User crafts own prompt"
  4. fallback_examples: "Show example prompts → User adapts as needed"

USER_FLEXIBILITY: "Complete override capability - user expertise always takes precedence"
```

## Intelligent Prompt Formula

### Master Formula
```yaml
PROFESSIONAL_PROMPT_STRUCTURE:
  context_injection: "[INDUSTRY] + [COMPANY_PERSONALITY] + [PROJECT_TYPE]"
  specificity_requirement: "Never generic, always [SPECIFIC_REFERENCE_SITE] approach"  
  brand_integration: "Apply [COMPANY]_brand_assets systematically"
  quality_benchmark: "Match [APPROVED_REFERENCE_SITES] sophistication level"

FORMULA_APPLICATION:
  generic_avoided: "Create professional homepage"
  intelligent_result: "Create homepage with hero like [SPECIFIC_REFERENCE], navigation matching [COMPANY]_brand_guidelines, optimized for [INDUSTRY]_conversion_patterns"
```

### Context-Aware Prompt Generation

#### SuperDesign Prompting
```yaml
SUPERDESIGN_PROMPT_INTELLIGENCE:
  initialization_pattern: |
    "Initialize SuperDesign with:
    - Design Philosophy: [COMPANY_BRAND_PERSONALITY] + [APPROVED_REFERENCE_APPROACH]
    - Color Palette: [COMPANY_BRAND_COLORS] (specific hex codes)
    - Typography: [COMPANY_FONTS] with [REFERENCE_SITE] hierarchy approach
    - Layout Inspiration: [SPECIFIC_APPROVED_SITES] patterns
    - Industry Context: [INDUSTRY]_professional_standards"
    
  wireframe_pattern: |
    "Create 5 wireframe variations for [PAGE_TYPE]:
    
    REFERENCE INSPIRATION:
    - Layout structure like [SPECIFIC_SITE_A]: [exact description from mood board]
    - [PAGE_TYPE] approach like [SPECIFIC_SITE_B]: [exact pattern from research]
    - Content hierarchy matching [COMPANY_VALUE_PROPS] priority
    
    BRAND REQUIREMENTS:
    - Colors: [COMPANY_HEX_CODES] from brand guidelines
    - Typography: [COMPANY_FONTS] with [INDUSTRY]_hierarchy
    - Personality: [COMPANY_BRAND_PERSONALITY]
    
    INDUSTRY STANDARDS:
    Apply [INDUSTRY]_professional_requirements and [INDUSTRY]_conversion_patterns"
```

#### Component Selection Prompting
```yaml
COMPONENT_PROMPT_INTELLIGENCE:
  discovery_pattern: |
    "Find professional [COMPONENT_TYPE] components for [INDUSTRY] [PROJECT_TYPE]:
    
    INSPIRATION MATCHING:
    - Visual style like: [SPECIFIC_APPROVED_SITE_ELEMENT]
    - Interaction pattern like: [SPECIFIC_REFERENCE_BEHAVIOR]
    - Professional level: [COMPANY_QUALITY_STANDARDS]
    
    BRAND INTEGRATION:
    - Colors: [COMPANY_BRAND_COLORS] (specific hex codes)
    - Typography: [COMPANY_FONTS] compatibility
    - Personality: [COMPANY_BRAND_PERSONALITY] expression
    
    INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Must meet [INDUSTRY]_professional_standards
    - Optimize for [INDUSTRY]_user_expectations
    
    Present 5 options that match these specific criteria."
```

### Prompting Guidance System

#### When User Wants to Prompt Themselves
```yaml
PROMPTING_FORMULA_GUIDANCE:
  provide_context: "Here's the context for your custom prompt:"
  context_package:
    industry_requirements: "[INDUSTRY]_standards and user_expectations"
    company_brand: "[COMPANY]_guidelines, personality, and quality_level"
    reference_sites: "[APPROVED_SITES] with specific elements to reference"
    project_context: "[PROJECT_TYPE] focus areas and success metrics"
    
  prompting_formula: |
    "Use this structure for professional results:
    1. Context: Reference [SPECIFIC_APPROVED_SITE] approach
    2. Brand: Apply [COMPANY_BRAND_ELEMENTS] systematically  
    3. Industry: Meet [INDUSTRY]_professional_standards
    4. Specificity: Never generic - always exact descriptions
    5. Quality: Match [REFERENCE_SITES] sophistication level"
    
  example_transformation:
    avoid: "Make a professional navigation"
    use: "Create navigation like [SPECIFIC_SITE]'s minimal sidebar approach, using [COMPANY] brand colors, optimized for [INDUSTRY] user efficiency"
```

### Quality Enhancement Patterns

#### Anti-Pattern Prevention
```yaml
NEVER_USE_PROMPTS:
  generic_requests: ["Make it professional", "Modern design", "Clean and minimal", "Eye-catching"]
  vague_directions: ["Make it better", "More attractive", "User-friendly", "Engaging"]
  ai_cliches: ["Sleek", "Cutting-edge", "State-of-the-art", "Next-level"]

ALWAYS_USE_APPROACH:
  specific_references: "Like [EXACT_SITE]'s [SPECIFIC_ELEMENT] with [EXACT_DESCRIPTION]"
  brand_integration: "Using [COMPANY]_[SPECIFIC_ASSET] from brand guidelines"
  context_awareness: "Optimized for [INDUSTRY]_[SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENT]"
  quality_benchmarks: "Matching [REFERENCE_SITE]'s level of sophistication"
```

#### Prompt Enhancement Suggestions
```yaml
PROMPT_IMPROVEMENT_SYSTEM:
  when_user_provides_generic:
    action: "Suggest enhancement using context formula"
    example: 
      user_prompt: "Create a good homepage"
      enhanced_suggestion: "Create homepage with hero like [APPROVED_REFERENCE], navigation matching [COMPANY] brand, optimized for [INDUSTRY] conversion?"
      
  when_user_provides_specific:
    action: "Validate against formula, suggest context additions if needed"
    enhancement: "Add industry standards and company brand integration"
```

## Implementation Guide

### System Integration
1. **Context Loading**: Automatically load industry + company context
2. **Prompt Generation**: Create intelligent prompts using formula
3. **User Presentation**: Present generated prompt for approval/modification
4. **Override Capability**: Accept user custom prompts without question
5. **Enhancement Offering**: Suggest improvements for generic user prompts

### User Interaction Flow
```yaml
PROMPTING_WORKFLOW:
  option_1: "Use system-generated intelligent prompt (recommended)"
  option_2: "Modify system prompt to your preferences" 
  option_3: "Provide your own custom prompt (full override)"
  option_4: "Get prompting formula guidance to craft your own"

FLEXIBILITY: "Complete user control with intelligent assistance available"
```

### Quality Assurance
- All prompts validated against anti-pattern list
- Context integration verified before execution  
- Reference specificity confirmed
- Brand asset integration validated
- Industry standards application checked
