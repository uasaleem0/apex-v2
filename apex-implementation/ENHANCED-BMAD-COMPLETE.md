## üé≠ **New Enhanced Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Planning**
```
Mary (Analyst) ‚Üí John (PM) ‚Üí Winston (Architect)
Market Research ‚Üí PRD & Stories ‚Üí Architecture & Bundle Creation
```

### **Phase 2: Story-by-Story Development**
```
Story Lifecycle (Per Bundle):
1. Sally: UI specification with full technical context
2. Developer: Implementation
3. Sally: Playwright validation & iterative refinement  
4. Enhanced QA: Security & technical testing
5. Story marked "Technically Complete"
```

### **Phase 3: Bundle Review & Iteration**
```
Bundle Review Cycle:
1. 3-5 stories technically complete
2. User comprehensive review
3. Changes categorized (low-risk/high-risk)
4. Implementation & validation
5. Repeat until user approval
6. Bundle deployment
```

### **Phase 4: Parallel Bundle Execution**
```
Independent Bundle Management:
- Bundle A: Complete and deployed
- Bundle B: User reviewing (Sprint 1.2)
- Bundle C: Development in progress  
- Bundle D: Planning phase (new feature)
```
