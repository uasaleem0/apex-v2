# Autonomous Implementation Guide
*Complete hands-off development from PRD to deployment*

## üéØ Overview

This enhanced BMAD-Lite system enables **completely autonomous implementation** where you make strategic decisions upfront, then let the system build your application for hours without interruption.

## üìã Complete Command Reference

### **Simplified Commands (New)**
```bash
claude analyze                    # Analyze project requirements & select MCPs
claude select-mcps               # Auto-configure project-specific MCPs  
claude validate-strategic        # Strategic validation with real-time data
claude check-ready              # Verify readiness for autonomous implementation
claude auto-implement           # Start hands-off implementation
claude fix-auto                 # Auto-apply standard fixes
claude batch-decide             # Collect all decisions at once
```

### **Existing Commands**
```bash
claude create-all-stories-from-prd  # Auto-create stories from PRD
claude validate-all-stories         # Standard story validation
claude story-map                    # Visual project breakdown
claude validation-status            # Validation dashboard
```

## üîÑ Complete Autonomous Workflow

### **Phase 1: Strategic Planning (You Present)**

**Step 1: Create Enhanced PRD**
```bash
"Help me create a PRD for my [project type]"
```
*Enhanced interview includes strategic blocker questions*

**Step 2: Auto-Analyze Project**  
```bash
claude analyze
```
*Identifies industry, integrations, compliance needs, scale requirements*

**Step 3: Auto-Select MCPs**
```bash
claude select-mcps  
```
*Configures project-specific MCPs for real-time validation*

**Step 4: Create Stories with Context**
```bash
claude create-all-stories-from-prd
```
*Stories now include blocker prevention and MCP context*

### **Phase 2: Strategic Validation (You Present)**

**Step 5: Strategic Validation**
```bash
claude validate-strategic
```
*Multi-layer validation with real-time MCP data*

**Example Output:**
```
‚úÖ AUTO-FIXED (15 items):
- Added password complexity to authentication
- Added WCAG 2.1 AA to all UI components
- Added rate limiting to all API endpoints
[...continues automatically...]

üìã BATCH DECISIONS NEEDED (5 items):
1. Social login integration? [affects auth, checkout] 
2. Real-time notifications? [affects architecture, cost]
3. Advanced search? [affects database, performance]
4. Mobile app vs responsive? [affects entire UX]
5. Email vs SMS alerts? [affects notification system]

‚ùå CRITICAL BLOCKERS (2 items):
1. BLOCKER: Instagram API requires business verification (2-week delay)
2. BLOCKER: Scale requires Redis caching (not in current tech stack)

üéØ RESOLUTION: Fix 2 blockers, make 5 decisions ‚Üí ready for autonomous implementation
```

**Step 6: Batch Decisions**
```bash
claude batch-decide
```
*Make all UX/feature decisions in one session*

**Step 7: Fix Critical Blockers**
*Address strategic issues (update PRD, change tech stack, etc.)*

### **Phase 3: Autonomous Implementation (You Leave)**

**Step 8: Final Readiness Check**
```bash
claude check-ready
```
*Verifies all decisions made, blockers resolved*

**Step 9: Start Autonomous Implementation**
```bash
claude auto-implement
```
*System implements everything without human intervention*

## ü§ñ What Happens During Autonomous Implementation

### **Automatic Process**
1. **Pre-flight Check**: Verifies all stories validated, decisions recorded
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Orders implementation automatically
3. **Progressive Implementation**: Builds story by story with validation
4. **Smart Continuation**: Handles minor issues automatically using Level 1 fixes
5. **Progress Logging**: Creates detailed implementation log
6. **Continuous Testing**: Runs tests after each story completion
7. **Graceful Completion**: Builds, tests, and prepares for deployment

### **Example Autonomous Session Log**
```
ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION STARTED - 14:00:00

‚úÖ Pre-flight Check Complete:
- 12 stories validated and ready
- 5 batch decisions recorded  
- 2 strategic blockers resolved
- MCPs configured and tested

üîÑ Implementation Progress:
14:01 - Starting: user-authentication (0 dependencies)
14:15 - Completed: user-authentication (auto-applied 8 fixes)
14:16 - Starting: database-schema (depends on user-auth)
14:28 - Completed: database-schema
14:29 - Starting: api-foundation (depends on database)
...
17:45 - Completed: All 12 stories implemented
17:46 - Running comprehensive validation suite
17:52 - All tests passing (94% coverage)
17:53 - Build successful (bundle: 234KB gzipped)
17:54 - Ready for deployment

üéØ AUTONOMOUS IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
Duration: 3h 54m

Tests: 127 passing  
Build: ‚úÖ Ready for production
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Three-Tier Validation System

### **Level 1: Auto-Fix (Silent)**
*Applied automatically without stopping*
- Password complexity requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Standard security headers and practices
- Performance optimization patterns
- Error handling and input validation
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### **Level 2: Batch Decisions (Collect Once)**
*Collected upfront, applied during implementation*
- Social login integration options
- Advanced feature enhancements
- User experience improvements  
- Optional third-party integrations
- Performance vs cost trade-offs

### **Level 3: Strategic Halt (Must Resolve)**
*Critical blockers that prevent implementation*
- External API availability issues
- Architecture scale mismatches
- Missing critical requirements
- Technical impossibilities
- Compliance gaps

## üìä MCP Integration Examples

### **Social Media Management Project**
```json
{
  "social-apis": "Validates Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn API access",
  "content-compliance": "Checks platform policy requirements", 
  "real-time-streaming": "Validates WebSocket/streaming capabilities",
  "multi-account": "Multi-tenant architecture validation"
}
```

### **E-commerce Platform Project**  
```json
{
  "payment-gateways": "Stripe, PayPal, Square API validation",
  "tax-compliance": "Regional tax calculation requirements",
  "shipping-apis": "FedEx, UPS integration validation", 
  "inventory-systems": "Real-time stock management validation"
}
```

## üéØ Benefits of Enhanced System

- Smart handling of minor issues
- Progressive validation and testing
- Detailed logging for transparency

### **Professional Quality Output**
