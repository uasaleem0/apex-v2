- **Validation Gates**: Quality enforcement and testing
- **Story Writer**: Auto-story creation from PRD
- **Product Owner**: Strategic validation and requirements alignment
- **Project Analyzer**: Industry analysis and MCP selection

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Required Setup**
1. **Edit `CLAUDE.md`** - Set your development preferences
2. **Configure Git** - Set up your repository preferences
3. **Set Environment Variables** - Add any API keys needed

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. **MCP Integration** - For enhanced validation capabilities
2. **Analytics Setup** - For autonomous optimization (Google Analytics, etc.)
3. **Company Context** - Add your company-specific data

---

## 🎯 **First Project Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Discovery (30-60 minutes)**
```bash
@apex-analyst
*research "your project domain"        # Market research
*competitive-analysis "competitors"    # Competitive landscape
*user-research "target audience"       # User needs analysis
```

### **Phase 2: Requirements (1-2 hours)**
```bash
@apex-pm
*create-prd                           # Interactive PRD creation
*create-story                         # Generate story set

# System automatically analyzes project and selects appropriate MCPs
```

### **Phase 3: Architecture (45-90 minutes)**
```bash
@apex-architect
*create-fullstack-architecture        # Complete system design
*create-bundle-structure              # Organize into development bundles
```

### **Phase 4: UI/UX (Per Bundle)**
```bash
@apex-ux
*validate-story "story-id"            # Story-by-story UI specification
*iterate-feedback "story-id"          # Playwright validation cycles
*sign-off-story "story-id"            # Final approval
```

### **Phase 5: Development**
```bash
/status                               # Monitor progress
claude build                         # Autonomous implementation
/review [bundle]                      # User review process
```

### **Phase 6: Optimization**
```bash
/apex-optimize weekly                 # Set up autonomous optimization
# System will now optimize your website/app weekly based on user data
```
