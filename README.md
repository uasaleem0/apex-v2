## 🎯 **Revolutionary Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Discovery (30-60 min)**
```bash
@apex-analyst
*research "project domain"          # Market opportunity analysis
*competitive-analysis "competitors" # Competitive landscape  
*user-research "target users"       # User needs and behavior
```

### **Phase 2: Requirements (1-2 hours)**
```bash
@apex-pm
*create-prd                        # Interactive PRD creation
