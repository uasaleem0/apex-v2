- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions with Supabase database
- **CMS:** Sanity Studio with custom schemas for psychological content
- **Deployment:** Vercel Edge Network with global CDN optimization

**Performance Targets:**
- Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- Mobile-first optimization for 70% mobile user base
- Contemplative interaction timing (800ms-1200ms animations)

### 2. AI-Driven Optimization System (INNOVATIVE FEATURE)
**Data Collection Pipeline:**
- Microsoft Clarity integration for heat maps and session recording
- Plausible Analytics for privacy-compliant user behavior tracking
- Custom event tracking for psychological content effectiveness
- Qualification form abandonment and hesitation pattern analysis

**AI Analysis Engine:**
- Weekly GPT-4 analysis of user behavior patterns
- Automated content optimization recommendations
- A/B testing framework with performance monitoring
- Safe automated changes (animation timing, content ordering)
- Strategic recommendations requiring approval (content rewrites, layout changes)

**Implementation Architecture:**
```typescript
// AI Optimization Pipeline
/api/ai-optimization/
├── collect-analytics.ts       # Weekly data aggregation  
├── analyze-behavior.ts        # GPT-4 analysis pipeline
├── generate-changes.ts        # Auto-implement safe changes
├── suggest-improvements.ts    # Strategic recommendations
└── performance-monitor.ts     # Track optimization results
```

### 3. Automated Podcast Processing System
**Workflow Architecture:**
1. Admin uploads audio file to Sanity CMS
2. Webhook triggers serverless function
3. OpenAI Whisper API transcribes audio
4. GPT-4 processes transcript into blog post format
5. Auto-generates SEO metadata and internal links
6. Creates draft blog post for review and publishing
7. Deploys to /podcast/episode-slug with full SEO optimization

**SEO Benefits:** Each podcast becomes cornerstone content with transcription, driving organic traffic

### 4. Psychology-Based User Experience
**Contemplative Mobile Pattern:**
- Slower animation timing supporting psychological processing
- Progressive content revelation with natural pause points
- "Grounded" micro-interactions reflecting brand values (inward focus, contemplation)
- Qualification flow feeling therapeutic rather than sales-focused

**Conversion Flow Technical Requirements:**
- Single-page journey: Hero → Pain Points → Paradigm Shift → Qualification → Booking
- Multi-step qualification with auto-save and session recovery
- Seamless third-party integration (Motion calendar, Notion CRM)
- Advanced form state management with psychological behavior tracking
