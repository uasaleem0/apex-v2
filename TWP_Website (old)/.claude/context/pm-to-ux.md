# Context Handoff: PM → UX

## Summary
Completed comprehensive PRD transformation from analyst's project brief, creating detailed technical requirements and user stories for The Wisdom Practice website. Focus remains on conversion-optimized psychology-based funnel for masculine development coaching.

## Key PRD Outputs Created
- **Complete PRD:** docs/prd.md with 12 functional requirements, 10 non-functional requirements
- **3 Strategic Epics:** Foundation/Infrastructure → Content/Brand → Advanced Features
- **12 Detailed User Stories:** Each with acceptance criteria sized for AI agent execution
- **Technical Architecture:** JAMstack with React/Next.js, serverless functions, third-party integrations
- **Integration Specifications:** Motion calendar, Notion CRM, Spotify podcast integration

## Critical UX Design Requirements

### Psychology-Based Conversion Funnel
- **Mirror Moment Strategy:** Hero section must immediately reflect target audience internal struggles
- **Progressive Recognition:** Each section builds "that's exactly me" moments for 18-30 males
- **Friction-Based Qualification:** Multi-step forms increase psychological investment to filter serious prospects
- **Single-Page Flow:** Complete journey from recognition to booking without distraction

### Target Audience Psychology (CRITICAL)
- **Core Identity Conflict:** "Calm alone, reactive in real life" - knowing ideal self but struggling to embody it
- **Limiting Beliefs:** "If I were truly evolved, I wouldn't get triggered" / "I should be further along"
- **Hidden Pattern:** Uses presence as performance, not way of being - confuses performance with authenticity
- **Pain Points:** Social shape-shifting, performing calm while feeling tense, constantly tweaking approaches

### Brand Identity Integration
- **Color Palette:** Charcoal black, rust, beige/sand + one additional
- **Voice:** Authentic, direct, empowering without aggression
- **Brand Essence:** "Awakening" rather than inspiring - "who they are right now is already enough"
- **Aesthetic:** Professional yet personal, masculine development focused, avoiding spiritual cliché

### Mobile-First Technical Requirements
- **Primary Platform:** 18-30 males primarily use mobile devices
- **Load Speed:** Sub-3 second load times critical for retention
- **Touch Optimization:** Form interactions optimized for mobile completion
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Content revelation strategy for smaller screens

## UX Architecture Priorities

### Conversion Flow Design
1. **Hero/Mirror Moment:** Pain recognition and immediate resonance
2. **Problem Deep-Dive:** Self-identification with specific struggle patterns  
3. **Solution Differentiation:** Pattern recognition vs surface-level fixes
4. **Trust Building:** Minimal credibility without distraction from booking
5. **Qualification Funnel:** Progressive commitment filtering (4-5 steps)
6. **Calendar Integration:** Seamless Motion booking maintaining momentum

### Secondary Page Strategy
- **About Page:** Complete personal story for backup engagement
- **Podcast Page:** Separate Spotify integration - NO main page distraction
- **Thank You/Confirmation:** Post-booking expectation setting

### Critical Design Constraints
- **Podcast Integration:** Separate page ONLY - minimal main page mention
- **Trust Building:** Authority indicators without overwhelming conversion focus
- **Future Architecture:** Design foundation supporting membership/course areas
- **Qualification Strategy:** Multi-step friction that increases psychological investment

## Technical Integration UX Requirements

### Form Design Specifications
- **Multi-Step Qualification:** Progressive stages with clear progress indication
- **Mobile Form Optimization:** Appropriate keyboard types, touch-friendly inputs

### Calendar Integration UX
- **Seamless Transition:** Qualification completion flows directly to booking
- **Mobile Calendar Optimization:** Touch-friendly date/time selection
- **Confirmation Flow:** Clear booking details and expectation setting
- **Timezone Handling:** Automatic detection and appropriate display

### Performance UX Requirements
- **Loading States:** Brand-consistent loading indicators
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with recovery options

## Critical Success Metrics for UX

- **Qualification Completion:** Multi-step form completion rates indicate proper friction balance
- **Mobile Performance:** Conversion rates maintain across mobile/desktop platforms
- **Trust Building:** Authority established without overwhelming conversion focus
- **Booking Conversion:** Seamless transition from qualification to calendar booking

## Risk Considerations for UX
