# The Wisdom Practice Website Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Generated by:** PM Agent (John)  
**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Project:** TWP_website  
**Methodology:** Enhanced BMAD

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Generate qualified coaching leads through strategic call booking funnel
- Build authority and trust through minimal podcast integration on separate page
- Create conversion-optimized user journey targeting males 18-30 stuck in self-development loops
- Establish foundation for future membership area and course sales
- Implement multi-step qualification system to filter serious prospects only
- Deliver mobile-first responsive experience for target demographic

### Background Context

The Wisdom Practice is addressing a critical gap in masculine development coaching. While the market is saturated with surface-level self-improvement content, our target audience of emotionally intelligent males (18-30) remains stuck despite extensive personal development work. They experience a core identity conflict: knowing who they are in solitude but struggling to embody that authentic self in real-world interactions.

The website serves as the primary lead generation vehicle for The Wisdom Practice's 12-session one-to-one coaching program, specifically designed to help these men break free from performance-based authenticity and discover their genuine presence. Unlike competitors who focus on technique or inspiration, we address the deeper pattern recognition and belief systems that keep men trapped in reactive behaviors despite their spiritual and emotional work.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a sophisticated, masculine-development focused experience that immediately resonates with emotionally intelligent men who are stuck despite extensive self-work. The design should feel professional yet deeply personal, avoiding both corporate sterility and spiritual cliché. Every element serves the singular goal of guiding qualified prospects through psychological recognition to booking commitment.

The user experience follows the psychological principle of "mirror moments" - each section should create recognition moments where visitors think "that's exactly me" while building toward the realization that their current approaches aren't working because they're addressing symptoms rather than root patterns.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Single-page flow reveals information strategically to maintain engagement
- **Psychological Mirroring:** Content reflects internal struggles before presenting solutions
- **Friction-Based Qualification:** Multi-step forms increase psychological investment and filter commitment levels
- **Mobile-First Navigation:** Touch-optimized interactions for primary user base
- **Authority Through Subtlety:** Credibility building without overwhelming conversion focus
- **Calendar Integration:** Seamless booking experience maintains momentum from qualification

### Core Screens and Views
- **Hero/Mirror Moment Section:** Immediate pain recognition and problem identification
- **Problem Deep-Dive Section:** Self-identification area for specific struggle patterns
- **Solution Differentiation Section:** Pattern recognition approach vs surface-level fixes
- **Trust Building Section:** Minimal about information and authority indicators
- **Qualification Funnel:** Multi-step progressive commitment form
- **Calendar Booking Interface:** Motion calendar integration for call scheduling
- **About Page:** Complete personal story and credibility for backup engagement
- **Podcast Page:** Separate Spotify integration and episode showcase
- **Thank You/Confirmation:** Post-booking engagement and expectation setting

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Implement WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with diverse needs while maintaining the masculine development brand aesthetic.

### Branding
**Color Palette:** Charcoal black, rust, beige/sand with one additional complementary color
**Voice:** Authentic, direct, empowering without aggression - "awakening" rather than inspiring
**Brand Essence:** "You are not here to inspire — you are here to awaken. You help people remember what they've buried: that who they are right now is already enough."
**Logo Integration:** Existing unique logo incorporated throughout design
**Typography:** Professional masculinity avoiding both corporate coldness and spiritual fluffiness
