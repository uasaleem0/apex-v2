      timeline: "Same day implementation"
      
    high_risk_changes:
      examples: ["new form fields", "navigation changes", "user flows", "API modifications"]
      process: "Winston architecture review â†’ Implementation decision"
      options:
        safe_implementation: "Implement in current sprint"
        complex_deferral: "Defer to next sprint with proper planning"
    
  11_iterative_refinement:
