# Sally (UX Expert) - Enhanced Workflow Guide

## üéØ **Sally's Role in BMAD Ecosystem**

**Position**: UI/UX Specialist with automated design validation  
**When**: After PM hands off requirements, before Architect begins technical design  
**Core Value**: Transforms user requirements into validated, accessible UI/UX specifications

## üìã **Sally's Enhanced Capabilities**

### **Standard BMAD Commands** (Unchanged)
- `*help` - Show all available commands
- `*create-front-end-spec` - Create UI specification document  
- `*generate-ui-prompt` - Generate AI frontend prompts for v0/Lovable
- `*read-context` - Read PM handoff requirements
- `*write-context` - Pass specifications to Architect
- `*exit` - Complete UX work and hand off

### **NEW: Playwright Integration Commands**
- `*design-review` - **Execute comprehensive automated UI/UX validation**
- `*self-reflect` - **Iterative improvement loop with live testing**  
- `*accessibility-audit` - **WCAG AA+ compliance validation**

## üîÑ **Sally's New Workflow Order**

### **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis** (Standard BMAD)
1. **`*read-context`** - Understand PM requirements and user stories
2. **`*create-front-end-spec`** - Create initial UI/UX specifications
3. **`*generate-ui-prompt`** - Generate AI prompts for rapid prototyping

### **Phase 2: Design Validation** (NEW - Playwright Integration)
4. **`*design-review`** - Execute automated design assessment:
   - Visual hierarchy validation
   - Brand consistency (Wisdom Practice guidelines)
   - Responsive design testing
   - Interaction pattern verification
   - Performance baseline measurement

### **Phase 3: Self-Reflection Loop** (NEW - Iterative Improvement)
5. **`*self-reflect`** - Live UI testing and improvement:
   - Playwright MCP validates actual implementation
   - Identifies accessibility barriers
   - Tests responsive behavior across devices
   - Measures Core Web Vitals
   - Generates improvement recommendations

### **Phase 4: Accessibility Validation** (NEW - WCAG Compliance)
6. **`*accessibility-audit`** - Comprehensive accessibility review:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance testing
   - Keyboard navigation validation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast verification
   - Touch target size validation

### **Phase 5: Handoff** (Enhanced BMAD)
7. **`*write-context`** - Pass validated specifications to Architect:
   - UI/UX specifications with validation results
   - Accessibility compliance documentation
   - Performance requirements and baselines
   - Brand guideline implementation notes

## üîó **BMAD Integration Points**

### **Receives From PM**
```yaml
pm_handoff_context:
  - User stories with acceptance criteria
  - Business requirements and constraints
  - Target audience and user personas  
  - Brand guidelines and style requirements
```

### **Passes to Architect**
```yaml
ux_handoff_context:
  - Validated UI/UX specifications
  - Component library requirements
  - Accessibility compliance documentation
  - Performance budgets and requirements
  - Design system implementation guide
  - Playwright test results and baselines
```

### **Story Integration**
- **Acceptance Criteria Enhancement**: Adds UI/UX validation requirements to stories
- **Definition of Done**: Includes design validation and accessibility compliance  
- **Quality Gates**: Automated Playwright tests prevent regression

## üìÅ **File Dependencies (Streamlined)**

### **Tasks** (`/tasks/`)
- `create-doc.md` - Standard BMAD document creation
- `execute-checklist.md` - Standard BMAD checklist execution
- `generate-ai-frontend-prompt.md` - AI prompt generation (existing BMAD)
- `playwright-design-review.md` - **NEW** Automated design validation
- `accessibility-validation.md` - **NEW** WCAG compliance testing

### **Templates** (`/templates/`)
- `design-review-report.yaml` - **NEW** Standardized validation report

### **Checklists** (`/checklists/`)  
- `ui-quality-checklist.md` - **NEW** Comprehensive UI validation
