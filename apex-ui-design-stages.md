# APEX UI Design Stages

## Overview
Two-stage UI design approach to optimize token usage and ensure quality outcomes.

## Stage 1: Visual Concept & Feel
**Goal**: Establish overall design direction before any code implementation

### Methods:
- **Figma designs** - Complete visual mockups with proper spacing, colors, typography
- **Design images** - Concept art, mood boards, style references
- **Wireframes** - Layout structure and user flow planning

### Deliverables:
- Visual style guide (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Key page layouts and components
- User experience flow
- Mobile/responsive considerations

### Benefits:
- No token waste on premature HTML/CSS
- Clear design direction before development
- Stakeholder alignment on visual approach
- Comprehensive planning reduces iteration

## Stage 2: HTML/CSS Implementation
**Goal**: Convert approved designs into functional code

### Prerequisites:
- Stage 1 designs approved
- Core features and functionality decided
- Technical requirements defined

### Process:
- Convert Figma/images to semantic HTML
- Implement responsive CSS based on designs
- Create reusable component library
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Benefits:
- Focused implementation with clear targets
- Minimal design iteration during coding
- Efficient token usage on actual development
- Higher quality output with design foundation

## APEX Integration
- Use `@ux-expert` agent for Stage 1 design review
- `@architect` for technical feasibility assessment
- `@build-manager` for Stage 2 implementation
- Visual validation with Playwright MCP after implementation

## Best Practices
1. **Never skip Stage 1** - Always establish visual direction first
2. **Get approval** before moving to Stage 2
3. **Document decisions** - Record design rationale and constraints
4. **Plan for responsive** - Consider all screen sizes in Stage 1
5. **Token efficiency** - Batch similar design elements together
