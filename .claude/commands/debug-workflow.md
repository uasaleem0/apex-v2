Please help me debug this issue using our standard workflow:

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - What exactly is failing?
   - When does it occur?
   - What's the expected vs actual behavior?

2. **Gather Context**
   - Check recent changes (git log)
   - Review relevant code sections
   - Look for error messages/logs

3. **Systematic Investigation**
   - Reproduce the issue
   - Add logging/debugging output
   - Test in isolation

4. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify the exact source
   - Understand why it's happening

5. **Fix & Verify**
   - Implement the fix
   - Test thoroughly
   - Update tests if needed

Let's start with step 1 - please describe the issue you're facing.
