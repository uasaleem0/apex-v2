## ðŸ”„ **Workflow Integration Examples**

### **Complete Bundle Development Cycle**
```bash
# 1. Project Planning
@analyst              # Market research and discovery
*research "target market analysis"
*exit

@pm                   # Requirements and story creation
*create-prd
*create-story
*write-context
*exit

@architect           # Architecture and bundle creation
*read-context
*create-fullstack-architecture
*write-context
*exit

# 2. Story-by-Story Development
@ux-expert           # UI specification (per story)
*read-context
*design-review
*write-context  
*exit

# Developer implements story...

@ux-expert           # UI validation
*validate-story
*iterate-feedback     # If changes needed
*sign-off-story      # When complete
*exit

@bmad-enhanced-qa    # Technical validation
*validate-story
*security-scan
*performance-test
*exit

# 3. Bundle Review
/status              # Check bundle completion
/review B            # User reviews Bundle B
# Provide feedback...

# 4. Continue with next bundle
/bundle C            # Switch to Bundle C
/sprint status       # Check development progress
```

### **Dynamic Feature Addition Flow**
```bash
# While Bundle B is in development...
/add-feature "user profile pictures with upload and cropping"

# System automatically:
# 1. Routes to @pm (John) for story creation
# 2. Routes to @architect (Winston) for dependency analysis  
# 3. Creates Bundle D if independent
# 4. Notifies when ready for development

/bundle D            # Switch to new bundle when ready
/status              # See Bundle D in planning status
```

### **Multi-Bundle Management**
```bash
# Monitor multiple bundles simultaneously
/status              # Overview of all bundles

# Example output shows:
# - Bundle A: Complete and deployed
# - Bundle B: Awaiting your review (high priority)  
# - Bundle C: Development in progress
# - Bundle D: Planning phase (new feature)

/review B            # Review Bundle B
# After review completion...

/bundle C            # Check Bundle C progress
/sprint status       # See Bundle C development status

/bundle D            # Plan Bundle D
@pm                  # Work with John on Bundle D requirements
```
