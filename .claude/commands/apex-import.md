**üöÄ Import any project and instantly know where you are in the APEX development lifecycle!**

**Start with `/apex-import` to see exactly what phase your project is in and what to do next.**

## Integration with Context Generation

When APEX import detects a project, it automatically:
1. **Analyzes the project** to determine industry and software type
2. **Triggers context generation** via @apex-context-generator
3. **Creates PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** with specialized workflows
4. **Provides next steps** using context-aware recommendations

This ensures every imported project immediately benefits from industry and software-type specialized workflows.
