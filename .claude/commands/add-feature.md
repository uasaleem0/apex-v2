# Dynamic Feature Addition System

**Usage**: `/add-feature "description"`

**Purpose**: Seamlessly add new features at any point in development with intelligent workflow routing.

## Feature Addition Workflow

### Phase 1: Intelligent Capture
```yaml
feature_capture:
  input_parsing:
    - Natural language description processing
    - Context awareness (current bundle, development stage)
    - Priority inference from language cues
    - Complexity estimation from description
  
  immediate_response:
    - Acknowledge feature request
    - Provide estimated analysis time
    - Continue user's current workflow
    - Background processing initiated
```

### Phase 2: Automated Analysis Pipeline
```yaml
analysis_pipeline:
  pm_analysis:
    agent: "John (PM)"
    tasks:
      - Create detailed story from description
      - Estimate development effort
      - Identify user acceptance criteria
      - Assess business priority
    
  architectural_analysis:
    agent: "Winston (Architect)"
    tasks:
      - Dependency analysis with existing bundles
      - Technical complexity assessment
      - Integration point identification
      - Bundle placement recommendation
    
  integration_decision:
    options:
      - add_to_existing_bundle
      - create_new_bundle
      - requires_architecture_changes
      - defer_for_complexity
```

### Phase 3: Intelligent Placement
```yaml
placement_logic:
  add_to_existing_bundle:
    criteria: "Low complexity, fits existing architecture"
    process: "Add story to current bundle backlog"
    timeline: "Next sprint cycle for that bundle"
    
  create_new_bundle:
    criteria: "Independent feature, no existing dependencies"
    process: "Create Bundle D/E/F with new dependencies"
    timeline: "Can start immediately or when prioritized"
    
  architecture_changes:
    criteria: "Requires system-wide modifications"
    process: "Architecture change proposal → User approval → Implementation"
    timeline: "Next major release cycle"
    
  complexity_deferral:
    criteria: "Requires significant research/planning"
    process: "Add to product backlog with research tasks"
    timeline: "Future sprint with proper planning"
```

## Context-Aware Intelligence

### Current State Awareness
```yaml
context_intelligence:
  user_activity:
    - Bundle review in progress → Don't interrupt, queue analysis
    - Development monitoring → Provide immediate feedback
    - Planning session → Integrate into current planning
  
  system_state:
    - Active development → Assess impact on current work
    - Between sprints → Can prioritize new feature
    - Architecture phase → Integrate into architecture decisions
  
  resource_availability:
    - Agent availability → Schedule analysis appropriately
    - Development capacity → Consider implementation timing
    - Testing resources → Plan validation approach
```

### Smart Routing Logic
```yaml
routing_intelligence:
  simple_features:
    examples: ["change button color", "add help text", "modify error message"]
    routing: "Direct to current bundle as low-risk change"
    timeline: "Immediate implementation"
  
  moderate_features:
    examples: ["add email notifications", "create dashboard widget", "new form field"]
    routing: "PM analysis → Bundle placement → Normal development cycle"
    timeline: "Next sprint cycle"
  
  complex_features:
    examples: ["user role system", "payment integration", "third-party API"]
    routing: "Full analysis pipeline → Architecture review → Planned implementation"
    timeline: "Major release planning"
  
  transformational_features:
    examples: ["mobile app", "real-time collaboration", "multi-tenancy"]
    routing: "Strategic planning → Architecture redesign → Phased implementation"
    timeline: "Product roadmap integration"
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Background Processing
```yaml
async_processing:
  immediate_acknowledgment:
    - User receives confirmation
    - Analysis queued for background processing
    - Current workflow continues uninterrupted
  
  parallel_analysis:
    - PM analysis runs concurrently
    - Architecture review runs concurrently
    - Results consolidated automatically
  
  smart_notifications:
    - Non-intrusive updates during analysis
    - Priority-based interrupt logic
    - Context-appropriate timing for results
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
system_integration:
  bundle_management:
    - Automatic bundle creation when needed
    - Dependency graph updates
    - Story prioritization within bundles
  
  agent_coordination:
    - John (PM) receives feature for story creation
    - Winston (Architect) receives for dependency analysis
    - Sally (UX) queued for UI specification when ready
  
  user_workflow:
    - Minimal interruption to current activities
    - Clear status tracking for new features
    - Integration with existing status dashboard
```

### Data Management
```yaml
feature_tracking:
  feature_requests:
    - Unique feature ID generation
    - Original description preservation
    - Analysis results storage
    - Implementation tracking
  
  decision_audit:
    - Why feature placed in specific bundle
    - Architecture decisions made
    - Timeline rationale
    - Resource allocation reasoning
  
  progress_monitoring:
    - Analysis completion status
    - Implementation progress tracking
    - User approval milestones
    - Deployment readiness
```
